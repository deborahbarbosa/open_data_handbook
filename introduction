##introduction
New technologies now can make possible to build the services to answer, automatically, questions as:

- How much of tax money is spent to water squares' plants
- What is the shortest and safest route from my home to university
- What is the air that i breathe along the way
- Where in my region i can find the best job opportunities
- Fruit trees per capita
- When can I influence decision about topics I deeply care about and whom should i talk to
- Much of the data we need is generated by public bodies. However often the data required is not yet available in a form which is easy to use.

In 2009 open data started to become visible in the mainstream, with various governments (USA, UK, Canada and New Zealand) announcing new iniciatives towards opening up their public information.

Open data or open government data is the information, public or otherwise, which anoyone can access and re-use for free and for any purpose.

This handbook talks about basic concepts of open data and how it creates value and can have a positive impact in many different areas. It also provides information about how to produce open data.
